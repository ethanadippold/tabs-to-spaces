# tabs-to-spaces
## About
This project is a Python-based file processing tool designed to standardize text file formatting by replacing tab characters with a fixed number of spaces. It reads an input text file line by line, detects tab characters at the character level, and reconstructs each line with consistent spacing to preserve visual alignment.

The script demonstrates fundamental systems-oriented programming concepts such as file input/output, character-level parsing, conditional logic, and output generation. By producing a cleaned, consistently formatted output file, this tool helps prevent downstream formatting issues in systems that do not handle tab characters reliably.

This project reflects real-world data sanitation and preprocessing tasks commonly required in system integration, data validation, and workflow standardization.

## Features
- Replaces tab characters with a configurable number of spaces
- Preserves visual alignment of text after tab removal
- Processes files line by line to ensure consistent formatting
- Outputs a cleaned text file suitable for downstream systems

## Technologies Used
- Python (standard library)
- File I/O
- String manipulation
- Conditional logic

## How to Run
1. Place the input file containing tab characters in the same directory as the script.
2. Update the input and output file names if needed.
3. Run the script:
